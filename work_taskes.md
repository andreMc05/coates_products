# What I've Done
- [x] Updated Vite version
- [x] Added a restaurant-style color scheme to the layout - a mild theme that unifies the overall look of the app
- [x] Emphasized the input and filter area to make it stand out, since it's where most user interaction occurs
- [x] Removed delete button from unavailable items, as they cannot be interacted with
- [x] Added emphasis to items in deletion confirmation dialog
- [x] Added sorting capability for available items
- [x] Limited delete button visibility to product management screen only.
