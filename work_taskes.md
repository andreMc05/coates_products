** WORK TASKS **
[x] I added a restaurant style color scheme to the layout. A mild theme that unifies the overall look of the app.
[x] I emphasized the input and filter area. Making it really standout since it is where most of the user interaction occurs.
[x] I removed the delete button from all items that were not available. If the user cannot interact with the item then there is no need to show the button.
[x] When a user selects to delete an item that item is emphasized in the confirmation dialog.
[x] Added a sort for available items.  
[x] I filtered the delete button to only show on the product management screen.
